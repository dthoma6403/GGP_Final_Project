## Mechanized Assault

### Listed Below are the steps for adding to the GitHub repository

I would like to first state if you aren't using TortoiseSVN, use it, you can download it, [here](https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html) . Once that is done, if I, John Miele, do not have you aa a contributor please contact me with your GitHub username and I will add you. Once you accept the invitation to collaborate follow these steps.

1. On the main page go to Branches right beneath the main progress bar.
2. Create a branch labled (Name)'s Branch. (You can find mine in that section as an example)
3. Once the branch is created you may then Clone the repo onto your designated folder using TortoiseSVN checkout, it will take some time to clone once files have been added.
4. Under branches you should see your branch along with the rest of the team.


### For submitting work through TortoiseSVN

To start if someone needs to give you a file to modify DO NOT modify the file in that persons branch and then commit their branch! That will create deficencies in the data and cause the branch owner to not be able to update and commit! So please, copy the file and re-upload it to your own branch and inform the receiever of the file where it is. Thank you, now onto the steps:

1. Stay organized in your branch, make multiple folders if necessary.
2. Place the item(s) you wish to commit in your branch.
3. Next, commit your whole branch! That means you go to the folder with (Your name)'s Branch to commit.
4. Right click on that folder and hit "Commit" a screen will pop up showing what is being uploaded or modified, select everything that is being uploaded.
4.a. If something says "Missing" since you deleted it from your folder, right click that item, and press delete. If not you'll get an error when commiting.
5. Make sure you write a message stating what has been added or changed to the file or files you're uploading.
6. Once everything is done make sure you press commit and let it fully upload.


## If any error occur while commiting or updating please let me know
## If these are any questions please feel free to ask
